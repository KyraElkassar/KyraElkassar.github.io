During week four, I attended a presentation about the use of AI in education. The presenter showed us ways how AI can be safely used in the classroom. We also had a discussion about the disadvantages of AI in the classroom and how we proctect our privacy and safety while using our AI. This week we also met our high school teacher mentor for the first time. Our mentor is Heather Moss, she is an 11th grade teacher at Chesapeake High School in Baltimore County whose main foucuses are Chemistry and Physics. It was a pleasure meeting her and I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to our group. I also continued to review literature and practice the basics of machine learning and Python. This week we completed the NumPy tutorial on W3schools. This gave me a basic understanding of the NumPy python library. This week we also made it a goal to find more transcriptomic datasets. After we found the datas sets we cleaned them and merged them with our previous findings. Our goal for this project is to find and clean over 1000 samples from individuals who have tumors that are either malignant or benign.
