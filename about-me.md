## About Me
Welcome to my website! My name is Kyra Elkassar and I am a rising sophmore who attends Towson University in Towson, MD. I am an Information Technology and with my degree I aspire to work in the BioTechnology field. I find it very intriguing how a company can interconnect biological sciences and technoligical sciences in order to best succeed their buisness processes. Knowing these sciences and advancing these technologies can greatly improve the lives of humans.
