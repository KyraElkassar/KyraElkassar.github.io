## About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is Kyra Elkassar and I am a rising sophomore who attends Towson University in Towson, MD. I am majoring in Information Technology, and with my degree, I aspire to work in the Biotechnology field. I find it very intriguing how a company can interconnect biological sciences and technological sciences to best succeed in their business processes. Understanding these sciences and advancing these technologies can greatly improve the lives of humans.
