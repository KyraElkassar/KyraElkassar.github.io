During week 2 we were able to meet with our graduate mentor and Dr. Paudel to discuss what our end project will look like and what software we will be using to test and train our final model. We will be using Google Colab to complete our project. This will allow each individual within our team to share codes within the group and also to monitor the work that we will be completing. This week we also went over the basics of Python coding as well as the basic machine learning algorithms that we will be using to complete the project. To do this, we used the website W3schools.com to complete the Python certificate and the YouTube channel CodeBasics to follow different exercises and projects. Overall I feel that these lessons helped me improve my skills in Python. Although I did not have much experience with coding, doing these online lessons helped me learn at my own pace, which also gave me time to take detailed notes that fit my learning style. Throughout this week we also completed a lesson on literary review. During this lesson, we went over databases that we can use to search for previous research done on our topic, as well as datasets. By the end of the week, we found around 25 different sources that we will be using for our literary review. This was a big accomplishment for our team as most of us had little to no prior background knowledge about lung cancer and our project. This was one of the most challenging parts of the week for me. As mentioned I have very little knowledge about Lung Cancer and the terminology surrounding the disease so I often found myself having to research the terms mentioned within the research papers. I do believe that this will prove to be beneficial for me though. Not only will this project help me gain new technological skills, but it will also help me advance my knowledge in a different sector of the curriculum. Overall this week was very productive and the lessons we learned throughout the week will serve as a strong foundation for my teammates and to continue to complete our research.
