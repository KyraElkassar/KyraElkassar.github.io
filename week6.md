During the begining of this my team and I met with Dr. Pandey to practice our presentation skills for the mid-summer symposium. She gav us tips in how to engage our audience, articulate our words, and much more helpful advice. This week we began the second part of our project.  We began researching ways that we can used feature selection methods in order to determine the top 10 genes that can be used to determine lung cancer. During this time we read previous researches that were done in order to compare the different ways we can build our model. One paper that I read used the Boruts Feature Selection method. Using this method we were able to rank the most important genes from our data sets. In the coming weeks we will be testing out diffferent feature selection methods. We also cleaned more data sets. We are now up to 600+ data samples to test our model. Looking for data sets is essential for our project to increase the acuracy of our model. We will also be tuning and adjusting the parameters of our model to increase the accuracy.
