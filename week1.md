During the first week, I met with Dr. Patel and my group members Jada and Shakina to discuss the project we will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Patel will be looking for. Dr. Patel also had us read one of his published research projects from last year. In this research paper, the researchers explained how they used genetic biomarkers to detect breast cancer in women. This is similar to the project with the exception of the variables being changed to lung cancer and the African American population. This week I also succeeded at my first Python coding class, as well as learning how to use Pandas, NumPy, and machine learning algorithms. This was my first time ever using these libraries so while it was hard, I was excited to be able to successfully run my codes and receive the expected output. Throughout this week, I found that I was able to learn and interpret Python faster and easier than C++. I am already familiar with C++ and I thought that the transition would be difficult for me as I've been learning this language for almost a year. But the instructors made the instruction easy for me to understand. While learning how to use Pandas, we used logistic algorithms to interpret and analyze datasets. Overall, I found this week very informative. I believe that the knowledge that I learned this week will definitely serve as a foundation for the skills I'm going to need to use during my project.
