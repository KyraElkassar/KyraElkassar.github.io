This week my team and I prepared for the final week of the CEAMLS SAIRI. This meant making any final touches neccesary to our technical paper. To do this we held frequent writing sessions with Dr. Anita Pandey. She was able to give us any corrections for any gramatical errors as well as anything that needed to be added or changed to make our paper publish worthy. Dr. Pandey has been very helpful throughout this process, as our paper has made signifcant progress compaed to our first draft. This week we also began prepping for our final presentation on July 30th. Since I wrote the results section of our paper, I was tasked with the results section of our presentation.
