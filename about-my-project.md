## About My Project

Develop a Machine Learning Model to detect Genetic Biomarkers and early prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets.

Problem: Testing diffrent genetic biomarkers to find which ones may be the leading cause of lung cancer can be very time consuming and costly. We are in need of a model that can predict the biomarkers of lung cancer in order to help prevent the lung cancer from spreading before its too late. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Capture data such as the genes that are present within individuals that are at risk of developing lung cancer as well as those who have lung cancer.
  - Process raw data, clean the data in order to find the genes that are most likely to develop lung cancer
  - using python coding, develop a system that can identify the genetic biomarkers and predict early lung cancer

Expected Outcome: Develop a Machine Learning Model to detect Genetic Biomarkers and early prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets. We will also develop a confrence paper presentation which will highlight the goals and outcomes of our project.
