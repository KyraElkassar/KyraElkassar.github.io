This week,  my group and I made a great improvement within our progress. This week the main focus was to find a way to convert the probe IDs found inside of our data sets to its Ensembl ID (ENSG) form, this is a nessecity for our model. When the probe ID is searched in a search engine like Google, Bing, etc. the results will not give you the gene name. We need the genes name to identify the gene as well as its purpose. Also when collecting multiple data sets, they may all be in a different probeID form. Some may be in affy while others are in illuminia. If we left these IDs, we would not be able to concatanate all of our data into one dataset. Through our literature review, we found that most researchers decide to use the database EnsemblID to convert their genes. Although, when we went to use this database, it did not work for us. We were now setback as we now did not have a way to convert our genes. We began researching new ways and we found that there is a package called mygene with python that converts the genes using python. After finding an effective way to convert the genes we were able to clean the datasets and acquire almost 500 samples to train and test our model. We began training and testing our model using a multitude of different models including logistic regression, random forest, desicion tree, and more. Our model was able to predict lung cancer with a 96% accuracy using random forest. In the coming weeks we will continue to collect and clean more data in order to improve our models accuracy. After we are satisfied with a models accuracy we will begin to use that data to predict the top 10 genes used in lung cancer.
