This week my team and I finished finalyzing our code for our project. We adjusted and fine tuneparameters that needed to by adjusted and fine tuned our model to ensure that was accuate before completely finalyzing the code. We also finished the process of feature selection. To do this we used the random forest classifer. This was a monumental step in our project because it indicated the the end is near! This process was fairly simple and I did not run into any complications while completing this task. Through feature selection our model was able to extract 10 genes that are potential biomarkers of lung cancer. Those genes are COL10A1, MEX3A, TFAP2A, MMP12, KIF2C, CCNB1, RMI2, CTHRC1, SPAG4, and SUGCT. After finalizing our code I began working on the results section of the resarch paper. I had a difficult time relaying the results in the form of writing, but after finishing the final paper, and proof reading, i think that I did a fairly good job. Im excited to read other groups research papers and I can't wait to start working on our final presentation!
