This week I worked on adjusting the parameters of our models, as well as introducing the Ensemble stacking technique in order to increase the accuracy of our model. This was a trial and error week for our team. Since we already had a high performing model, this week we just wanted to see how we could replicate these results using more advanced machine learning models. After reading more previous research I found that you could stack models using Ensemble. This helped us get a %99 accurracy on our model. This week we also presented our mid program report. This was a new experience for me as i've never presented my own research before. I think that our team did a good job at presenting our research but we still have improvements to make. I learned alot of presentation skills thanks to Dr.Pandey. Lastly, we began writing our final research paper. I have been assigned to write the results as well as a section of the methodology.
