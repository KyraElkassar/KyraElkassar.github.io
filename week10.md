This week was the final week of CEAMLS SAIRI. This experience was great. I enjoyed learning from my teamates, other participants, and our mentors throughout this program. There is no doubt that the skills learned throughout this program will be benificial to me in the future. On monday, my team and I prepared for our final presentation. We practiced multiple times in order to be well prepared for tuesday. On tuesday we had our final presentation. Our team did very well and im extremely proud of us. I also enjoyed the other listening to the other projects. My favorite project had to be EmotiGen. Theres progress was amazing and I truly believe that there web app can make a positive change in equitable AI.
